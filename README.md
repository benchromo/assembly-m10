COMP 3350 Assembly Language Programming Project 10

The main.asm file contains assembly language code that fulfills the requirements given in the attached pdf.

Exercise 1 prompts the user to enter two 32-bit hex numbers and then prints the number of bits that are different.
  ex. User enters 0 and F. The last four bits of 0 and F are different so the output is 4.

Exercise 2 prompts the user for a string of numbers (0-9), then prints the number of occurences for each digit 0-9.
  ex. User enters 1223. There is one 1, two 2's, and one 3, and zero of all other digits.

Exercise 3 prompts the user for a string and a 32-bit hex number N, then prints the first N characters in the given string.
  ex. User enters "Hello" and 2. The output will be "He", the first two char's of "Hello".
